The Foundation will consider the wish of any child diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition who is between the ages of 2-1/2 and 18 and lives anywhere in the state of Colorado. The entire family is included in the child's magical wish. The wish is a time which provides joy, respite and family healing and is a time when the focus is not on the child's illness. The magic we provide by granting a wish gets the whole family out of the hospital and offers them a time of fun and togetherness.",
