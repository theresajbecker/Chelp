README-for-Instructors: 

If you want to view the admin features under User Profile->Admin login as:
Email: Admin@Chelp.com
Password: ChelpAdmin

The uncompleted portions of the proposal and changes to our proposal:
We changed the views so that the filters are Region, Area of Impact, and Overhead. This is a modification on our original idea. 
Other features we decided to take away are the “add a favorite charities list” on the user profile page.
We decided not to have a page to ‘report a user’, however we completed an administration page. Other than these changes we followed our proposal. 

Test Coverage:
- Controller tests were generated by the rails scaffold generate commands
- Tests were not created for models which only inherited from ActiveRecord
- Tests of Note:

	/spec/requests/linkbar_spec.rb
		This was an integration test that was included to navigate to each view, check the text before and after logging in, and ensuring the correct text is displayed.

	/spec/views/layouts/application_spec.haml.rb
		This tests our partial view for the link bar logic whether a user is logged in or not
